Backups are an essential tool for everyone, whether they are server developers or the average end-user. **Backups make life safe.**

This is why we've developed a set of backup tools to make your life easy! In addition to taking your own backups, we take **daily off-site backups** on every server to ensure the most safe and available service for our users.

To take things even further, we've added additional functionality to the normal backup experience, including:

## Creating

To create a 1:1 copy of your server to store safely, head to:

`https://my.octant.gg/<server-id>/backups`  
Replace `<server-id>` with your actual server ID.

Below the description of the backup system, you can find the button named "**Create Backup**", which will open a modal with information you can fill out:

- **Backup name**: Name it something memorable, or leave it empty to autofill with a timestamp.
- **Ignored Files & Directories**: Enter paths relative to your main directory, e.g. `/plugins/Dynmap/*` to exclude all files in `Dynmap`.
- **Locked**: Prevent accidental deletion. Toggle the lock by clicking the three dots on the backup.

## Deleting

Our plans come with a soft limit of 3 backup slots (increasable for free). If you're out of slots, delete a backup by pressing the three dots on the backup and selecting "**Delete**". A confirmation modal will appear.

<Warning>
These backups **CANNOT** be recovered, so delete at your own risk.
</Warning>

## Restoring

Need to roll back after a misconfigured plugin or an unfortunate server event? Restoring is just two clicks away.

Click the three dots on the backup you want to restore. A modal will ask if you'd like to delete all current files before restoring. This **CANNOT** be reversed.

<Tip>Take a backup of the current state before restoring if you're unsure whether the backup will fix or break things.</Tip>

## Mounting

Sometimes you just need one file, not the whole server. That's where the **Backup Mounter** comes inâ€”it lets you mount a backup _as a folder_ in your file manager.

<Warning>
During the mounted backup process, power controls and similar tasks may be temporarily unavailable.
</Warning>

To mount, click the three dots on the desired backup, and it will appear in your file manager.

To unmount, press the icon on the mounted folder. Inside, you can:

- **Restore**: Restore the file/folder to its original location.
- **Move**: Restore it elsewhere using `../` to navigate out of the mounted folder.

## Off-site backups

We take redundant off-site backups **every 24 hours** with a **14-day retention**. To restore one, contact us via:

- [Email](mailto:support@octant.gg)
- [Discord](https://discord.gg/compute)
- Live chat

Provide:

- Your server ID
- Your email address
- The date of the backup you want restored

We'll take care of the rest.

<Warning>
We recommend taking another backup before we restore one for you, as rolling back restored backups is not possible.
</Warning>
