Is your server growing where you have the need for more performance or need to support more players? You can upgrade the plan of your server at any time to accomodate your needs

## Upgrading plan

Upgrading your server plan is self-serve and super easy to do. All your files stay intact and are saved when upgrading. Your existing server is upgraded as-is.

### 1. Go to Billing

Log in to the [Octant panel](https://my.octant.sh) and select the service you want to upgrade.

Then, on the left you'll find **Upgrade/Downgrade** (for RAM-based servers) or **Upgrade/Downgrade Options** (player slot-based servers, does not apply for Minecraft).

### 2. Choose your new plan

You’ll see options to select a new plan. Choose the plan that fits your needs based on resources like CPU, RAM, and/or player slots (does not apply for Minecraft).

After selecting a new plan, check out. Price changes and adjustments are done automatically— you're only billed the difference minus the number of days your cycle has been used (prorata).

### 3. Restart your server

Once upgraded, restart your server from the dashboard to apply the new resources. Your upgraded plan should now be active!
