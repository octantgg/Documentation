Done with your gameplay? You can cancel your Octant server subcription plan at any time with a click of a button.

### 1. Save any data

If needed, download any data or backups from your server before itâ€™s deactivated. Once cancelled, the server data will no longer be accessible.

You can upload the backup whenever you're ready to start a server again.

### 2. Go to Billing

Log in to the [Octant panel](https://my.octant.gg) and select the service you want to cancel.

### 3. Submit cancellation

Find your active plan and choose the **Request Cancellation** button. Then, write a brief reason to why you're cancelling your plan; this helps us immensely in improving our services!

Finally, select between **Immediate** or **End of Billing Period** cancellation and press **Request Cancellation**.
