<Warning>Ensure the version of the world matches the Minecraft version running on the Minecraft server</Warning> 

## Finding a singleplayer world from your computer

If you wish to upload a singleplayer world from your computer to a [Minecraft server](https://octant.sh/games/minecraft), follow these steps: 

### On Windows:

1. Enter `Windows Key + R` on your keyboard and enter `%AppData%`
2. Head to the `.minecraft` folder and then `/saves`
3. Locate the world you wish to upload, and archive the folder with a tool like [WinRAR](https://winrar.com) or [7Zip](https://7zip.com)

### On a Mac:

1. Navigate to `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft` folder by pasting the file path on your Mac's [Spotlight](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/search-with-spotlight-mchlp1008/mac)
2. Right click the world folder, and select "**Compress [fileName]**"

## Uploading the world to your server

1. Stop the server
2. [Upload the world archive](../../importing-files) to the **File Manager** on the [Octant panel](https://my.octant.sh)
3. Select the three dots beside the file, and click "**Unarchive**"
4. Modify the `level-name` value in `server.properties` file to the name of the world folder
5. Start the server!

And voil√†, you should now be able to use and play your custom world on your Minecraft server!
