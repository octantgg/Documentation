## Migrating to Octant

### 1. Zip Your Server Files

To begin, select all relevant server files at your current provider and **archive them into a `.zip` file** (or similar format). This makes the transfer process quick and easy.

### 2. Upload the Archive

Once the archive is ready, download it to your computer and **upload it via the Files tab** on the Octant panel.

If the archive is too large to upload through the panel, you can [use SFTP](./panel/importing-files) to transfer it instead.

### 3. Unpack the Archive

After uploading:

- Click the three dots beside the file and select **Unarchive**
- Ensure no other conflicting files are present before unpacking
- Make sure the server settings match the server type you're importing (e.g. **Paper**, **Forge**, **Fabric**, etc.)

You can update the settings in the **Startup tab** if needed.

### 4. Start Your Server!

With your files imported and settings configured, you’re ready to **start the server**.

If anything goes wrong or the server fails to boot, reach out to us via [email](mailto:support@octant.gg), [Discord](https://discord.gg/compute), or **live chat**—we’re happy to help!
