Migrating from another provider? We'll migrate your server data for you completly free of charge!

To have the Octant team migrate your server for you, complete step 1 and contact us via [email](mailto:support@octant.gg), [Discord](https://discord.gg/compute), or livechat. We will get the data and server migrated and setup for you!

## Migrating to Octant

### 1. Zip up server files

To make the transfer easy and seamless, select all of your files and data at your existing provider and archive them into a .zip or similar.


### 2. Upload the archive

Once you've created the archive, download it to your computer. Then, upload the archive to the **Files** tan on the Octant panel.

If the file size is too large, [use SFTP](./panel/importing-files) to import the archive.

### 3. Unpack the archive

Once it's uploaded, unpack the archive by clicking the three dots and select **Unarchive**. Make sure all other files are deleted before you unpack.

Then, ensure the server settings match the server data you are importing. For example, if you are migrating a Minecraft server, ensure you've selected the right software (e.g. Forge, Fabric, Paper, etc).

If it isn't set to the correct settings, update the settings in the **Startup** tan on the panel to match the config of your existing server.

### 4. Start the server!

Once you've imported your save data and ensured the configuration options and settings are appropriate to what you're running, start the server!

If the server fails to start, feel free to contact us via [email](mailto:support@octant.gg), [Discord](https://discord.gg/compute), or livechat.
