### 1. Choose a game

Head to [octant.gg](https://octant.gg) and select **Deploy a Server**. From them, select the game you'd like to play. We currently support the following games:

### 2. Checkout

Once you've selected the game, configure the options and check out:

- **Location**: the region your server will be in; pick the one closest to you/your players
- **Number of Players / RAM**: choose how many players will be on the server at most at one time, or pick how much GB of RAM your server should be.
- **Server Type**: select the version or type of server

Proceed by clicking **Launch Server**, and during checkout fill in the details to create your account and check out with the payment method of your choice. We currently support **credit/debit cards** and **PayPal**.

### 3. Login to the game panel

Once you've checked out and the order has been placed, you'll receive an email named **Account Created** in your inbox which has the link to login to the game panel.

Open the link and you'll be logged into the game panel with the server created there for you!

### 4. Connect to your server

You can now start up the server and connect to it! Select the server from the game panel and make sure it's online. If it isn't, press the **Start** button to start it.

Depending on the game, either copy the server IP from the panel and paste it in-game to connect to it, or search up the server's name in the game's server list.

### All done!
And voilà! Your server is now setup and you can start playing! You can further configure the server by customising the settings or install mods/plugins— the options are limitless.
